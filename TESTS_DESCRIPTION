# Temporary file with description of test cases for FEniCS study

1) Cook.py

This tests solves the 'Cook membrane' benchamrk with the FEniCS library. Its usage considers the following fields:

python Cook.py REFINEMENTS DEGREE METHOD

where:

- REFINEMENTS: The number of elements per side is multiplied by this factor
- DEGREE: Finite element degree to be used
- METHOD: One of Newton|Newton-inexact|BFGS|BFGS-inexact

It exports the solution to the 'images' folder.

2) Mechanics.py

Solve a simplified cardiac mechanics problem. Its usage is similar to the previous tests:

python Mechanics.py DEGREE METHOD

- DEGREE: Finite element degree to be used
- METHOD: One of 'Newton|BFGS'

It exports the solution to the 'images' folder.
